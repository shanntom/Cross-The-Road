What happens when the chick crosses the road? 

This is animation that drew inspiration from a mobile app game named "Crossy Road". The goal of the game is for the user to direct the chick to cross several roads while avoiding cars in order to reach the "other side." Once the game is cleared or a car has run over the chick, the game will reset in 5 seconds.
